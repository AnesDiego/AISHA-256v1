      <h1>Project Roadmap</h1>
      <p>Our project evolves in strategic phases:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Phase 1 (Current - Beta):</b> Automated 1-hour Bitcoin analysis, with the 2D avatar (AISHA-256v1) publishing hourly analyses via API. Focus on community building and feedback collection.</li>
        <li><b>Phase 2 (Visual & Content Expansion):</b> Transition to an ultra-realistic 3D avatar (AISHA-256vX) and dynamic video content production, where AISHA acts as an anchor/influencer. Expansion to multi-timeframe analyses (4h, daily).</li>
        <li><b>Phase 3 (Interactive Immersion & Universe Expansion):</b> Implementation of AI chat for direct interaction with avatars (with distinct personalities) and introduction of new specialized AI avatars in various fields (e.g., programmer, chef).</li>
        <li><b>Phase 4 (Ecosystem & Monetization):</b> Launch of NFTs (collectibles and utility-based) and a line of personalized merchandise inspired by the avatars.</li>
        <li><b>Phase 5 (Diversification & Multi-platform Growth):</b> Full expansion to major platforms like Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok, continuous exploration of new AI influencer niches, and the creation of a cryptocurrency for the AISHA universe to expand the ecosystem.</li>
      </ol>
